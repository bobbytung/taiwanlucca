He is like a star, guiding the direction for all travelers who get lost.

			What is love, ideally, for you? Is it a red string, with someone at the other end waiting for you? Or maybe like a neon lamp late at night, a fantasy? Perhaps it’s the internet world, so close yet so distant? These are stories of yearning, meeting, missed opportunities, and separations. Crystal Kung uses the colors of joy, haze, heartbreak, and relief to illustrate love, and to describe those searching for it."><img src="images/s5b3.jpg" alt="Four in Love"  class="cover2"/>
