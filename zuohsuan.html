			<p>In a piece of good luck, college student Chen Nuan-Nuan ends up paired with her crush, the indifferent but handsome Hsia Chih-Hsun, on a summer research project for her sociology professor. The two are tasked to research religious practices among indigenous cultures – but whose? The usually quiet Hsia suggests they research the indigenous community in Daxi.</p>
			<p>At their arrival, Nuan-Nuan discovers that this isn’t just a research trip for Hsia – it’s a return home, a trip he hasn’t made in seven years. The two of them conduct research during the build-up to the summer’s Temple Fair, the community’s most important festival, as Hsia tries uncomfortably to untangle the knot of his family’s past.</p>
