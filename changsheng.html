			<h3>YAN</h3>
			<p>Thirty years ago, the young Peking Opera performer Yan Tieh-hua was wrongly convicted of the murder of her own family and sent to prison. Twenty years later she died while still incarcerated. Yet, today, this same woman has mysteriously returned as a superpowered teen in Peking Opera costume, determined to avenge the massacre of her family.</p>
			
			<p>The officer who originally handled Yan Tieh-hua’s case is called back to active duty to deal with her reappearance, but the deeper he digs, the more he finds that nothing is as it seems. Complicating matters is a teenage chess prodigy with the ability to see five minutes into the future who joins Yan Tieh-hua’s crusade. What is the truth at the heart of the Yan family massacre? And what is the mysterious power that enabled Yan Tieh-hua’s return from the dead?</p>
